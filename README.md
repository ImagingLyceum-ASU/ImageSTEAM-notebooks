# ImageSTEAMnotebooks
This repository is a collection of google colab notebooks that give beginners a brief introduction to coding with python, manipulating images, pixel colors and lighting, and using neural networks for object classification and detection. This repository is an extension of the [ImageSTEAM](https://github.com/ImagingLyceum-ASU/ImageSTEAM) repository, so if you are interested in more information about the ImageSTEAM initiative or looking deeper into the code itself, please visit our other repo!
